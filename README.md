# TDMA-MIMO
In this illustration, we implement a TDMA-MIMO-based millimeter-wave radar raw data generation and signal processing stack that can support millimeter-wave radar platforms with different physical array element configurations and antenna emission sequences, as well as information estimation of moving targets, etc.
